#Explanation
"""
What it does:
This utility file acts as a lightweight agent that analyzes user questions and decides:

Structured query (SQL) ‚Üí if the question includes terms like "forecast", "Q1", "average", "SKU", etc.

Unstructured query (Pinecone) ‚Üí everything else (e.g., policies, summaries, qualitative text)

‚öôÔ∏è How it works:
Uses regex-based pattern matching for keywords (case-insensitive).

Easy to plug into your main app logic for routing.
